  Market Buddy is an application with which users can you use virtual currency to trade stocks. 

  My purpose in building this specific application is not to neccesarily create a ground breaking finance app, but rather to replicate similiar apps that are already on the market. As I continue to build Market Buddy, I want to demonstrate my ability to construct an industry standard application using a variety of common technologies. Additionally, I hope that I can convey a deep understanding of finance along with a passion for the field.

  Currently the functionality is limited to buying and selling stocks. I would consider this to be the minimum viable product. There are many ways in which the app will be improved, both in terms of technical improvment as well as implementing more complex financial transactions (varying order types, options, cryptocurrency, etc.)
  
 Below is a list of some of the improvements I would like to make in the near future:

1. Historical portfolio value feature. This is the only feature that I would consider to be part of the MVP that is not completely stable. There are many ways in which I could approach this task, so I want to take care in how I proceed.
2. Allow a user to view different historical timeframes. At the moment, the historical value of a stock is limited to YTD daily prices.
3. Cleaner and DRYer code. One of the most notable improvements I have observed in my work over the past few months is the quality of my code. I am satisfied with my work on this project, but I think doing a comprehensive refactor before moving forward with implementing more features would be worthwhile.
4. More generally, I would like to improve my use of version control. My branches are somewhat random and my commit messages are typically vague and incosistent.


Note: Unfortunately the project requires a premium IEX Cloud plan. While I aim to deploy the project to the internet in the near future, I will also be continually recording video demos of the project. In the event that the cost of hosting the project becomes prohibitive, those demos as well as the published code will provide a comprehensive overview of the process and results of the project.
