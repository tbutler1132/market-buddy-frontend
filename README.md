  Market Buddy is an application with which users can you use virtual currency to trade stocks. 

  My purpose in building this specific application is not to neccesarily create a ground breaking finance app, but rather to replicate some of the apps that are already on the market. As I continue to build it, I want to demonstrate my ability to construct an industry standard application using a variety of common technologies. Additionally, I hope that I can convey a deep understanding of finance along with a passion for the field.

  Currently the functionality is limited to buying and selling securities. I would consider this to be the minimum viable product. There are many ways in which the app will be improved, both in terms of technical improvment as well as implementing more complex financial transactions (varying order types, options, cryptocurrency, etc.)
  
  Below is a list of some of the improvements I would like to make in the near future:

1. Improve historical portfolio value feature. This is the only feature that I would consider to be part of the MVP that is not completely stable. There are many ways in which I could approach this task, so I want to take care in how I proceed.
2. Allow a user to view different historical timeframes. At the moment, the historical value of a stock is limited to YTD daily prices. Allowing the user to view different time scales is an important piece of functionality.
3. Stricter, more robust validations and general security. As I built the app, security was a bit of a secondary concern as my primary focus was building out the API and the UI. Despite my approach I realize that this type of application in particular requires very delicate attention to security. 
4. Cleaner and DRYer code. One of the most notable improvements I have observed in my work over the past few months is the quality of my code. I am satisfied with my work on this project, but I think doing a comprehensive refactor before moving forward with implementing more features would be worthwhile.
5. More generally, I would like to improve my use of version control. My branches are somewhat random and my commit messages are typically vague and incosistent.
