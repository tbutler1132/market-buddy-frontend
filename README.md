  Market Buddy is an application with which users can you use virtual currency to trade stocks. 

  My purpose in building this specific application is not to neccesarily create a ground breaking finance app, but rather to replicate similiar apps that are already on the market. As I continue to build Market Buddy, I want to demonstrate my ability to construct an industry standard application using a variety of common technologies. Additionally, I hope that I can convey a deep understanding of finance along with a passion for the field.
